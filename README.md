# ProductAnalysis 📊

This repository contains a project to analyze product data, derive insights, and visualize trends.  
The core analysis is in **Product.ipynb** and the sample dataset is **products_100_rows.csv**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore and analyze product-level data — pricing, categories, release dates, ratings, etc.  
We perform **data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization** to uncover insights.

## 📂 Data Description

- **products_100_rows.csv** → Sample dataset with ~100 rows of product information.  
  Common columns:
  - `product_id`
  - `product_name`
  - `category`
  - `price`
  - `rating`
  - `launch_date` / `Date`
  - `Year`, `Month`, etc.

## 🏁 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data analysis and visualization can uncover meaningful insights from product datasets.  
By cleaning the data, engineering new features, and applying exploratory data analysis (EDA), we can better understand:

- How product prices are distributed and where outliers occur  
- Category-level differences in pricing and ratings  
- Seasonal and temporal trends in product launches  
- Relationships between numerical features such as price and rating  

These findings can help businesses **make informed decisions** about pricing strategies, inventory planning, and market positioning.  
With further expansion (larger datasets, predictive modeling, dashboards), this analysis can evolve into a powerful decision-support tool.
